MVC : Model View Controller

Typical servlet : HTML code embedded into Java code, Typical JSP : Java code embedded into HTML code

M odel : data
V iew : data
C ontroller : manages application flow, makes a call to a some sort of service producing model and then passes on the model to the view.

Controller -> (Passes Model) -> to View

Inversion of Control or Dependency injection

Browser (request) -> Front controller -> Handler Mapping (Scan the URL; tells the exact address of the component which can generate data for the web request requested for -> Front
Controller -> Data generator (prepares data, creates Java object to hold the data - may take help of other Java classes if it is required to do the job) (Java Object which holding data + 
Name of the component which is going to retrieve data from the Java Object + mixing with HTML to generate actual response -> Front Handler -> View resolver (tells the address of the view maker)
-> Front Controller (Java Object) -> Final response builder (creates final response with HTML and Java Objects) -> Browser

Client -> Dispatcher Servlet -> Handler Mapping -> Dispatcher Servlet -> Controller -> Dispatcher Servlet -> View resolver -> Dispatcher Servlet -> JSP/ Velocity/ Freemaker -> Dispatcher Servlet
-> Client

Java object with data : model

/ : Dispatcher Servlet : Front handler

There are many HandlerMapping classes
